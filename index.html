    <p id="message">Millennia ago, Socrates claimed that, “To say ‘I know’ is to close one’s mind to knowledge”. Channelling that spirit at The City School, our motto is ‘I Am To Learn’, because we too believe that learning is limitless. We aim to develop each one of our students into true learners, individuals who always seek to broaden their perspective and to face life’s challenges with courage and conviction.

        For us, education is a pursuit that goes far beyond a qualification. While we aim to help our students excel in the course they are studying, we also hope to instil in them a thirst for learning throughout their lives.  At The City School, our teachers, students, and parents work together to realise this goal.
        
        Group Chairperson</p>
