        The Evergreens Academic/Training Department works very closely with teachers for <br> a common objective: to improve the quality of teaching and facilitate learning <br> in every way. Our high quality, standardized curriculum has produced some <br> of the best results in the country. The Academic /Training Department <br> has a robust Professional Development Programme for teacher training <br> and another  support function is to provide subject specific Term wise CRP <br> (Curriculum Resource Packs) Daily Lesson Plans (DLPs) and Assessment Packs to <br> teachers.

         DLPs allow teachers to focus on lesson implementation; this helps <br> in improving teaching standards by taking away
         the daily planning time and effort put <br> in by the teachers for the lesson planning. DLPs have been structured  around <br> the Curriculum Resource Packs (CRPs) subjects and incorporate interactive <br> teaching and learning approaches. Curriculum Resource Packs comprise of a scheme of studies related to a centralized book list of private and government publications. CRPs are developed for two terms respectively. 
        The teachers use these CRPs and DLPs to ensure effective teaching and learning in the classrooms.</p>
