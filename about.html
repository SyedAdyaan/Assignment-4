    <p id="aboutpara2">Graduates from The Evergreens School secure positions in top universities worldwide. Our students, according to Cambridge Assessment International Examinations annual results analysis, are amongst the highest achievers in their city, their country and, in some cases, in the world. The curriculum encourages a student-centered approach where learners have an active role in their learning process and develop the skills and ability to make a significant contribution to society. Its particular strength lies in the integration of digital media and ICTs in an array of learning programmes. The Evergreens School provides more than 120 courses each year across the age ranges and revises them in accordance with the cumulative experience of its teachers and pupils. The selection of teachers is based on their experience as curriculum developers and syllabus writers. In addition, we regularly appoint curriculum consultants from the UK to lead teams of The Evergreens School teachers in revising their curriculum and syllabi. The Evergreens School curriculum and methodology is designed specifically to ensure a smooth transition in teaching and learning from the primary sector through the middle years and on to the final two years of the public examinationsâ€™ syllabi. Digital media and ICTs in The Evergreens School Network are shaping the methodology of delivering online education and adding efficiency, convenience, interactivity and outreach to the array of learning programmes we offer. The Evergreens School has taken the initiative of implementing a state-of-the-art Classroom/ Learning Management System capable of providing its students with academic resources anytime, anywhere, and in any circumstances. The City School promotes and encourages co-curricular activities in all of its campuses.
         Students are encouraged to learn new skills, take responsibility, assume leadership, work
          under a leader, organise events, conduct programmes and experience real-life situations.</p>
